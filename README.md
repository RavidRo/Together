## A little bit about our app:

While using the app, most of your time will probably be spent browsing other people's posts.
You'll have 4 categories of posts to choose from:

-   Food: If you need it, or have leftovers you want to share.
-   Education: Do you know something that others don't? Do you need help learning something new? You can teach or ask for private lessons.
-   Giving Away: Throwing something away? Maybe someone else will need it! As the saying goes - one's trash is another's treasure.  
-   Anything Else: Have another way to help/ need something that doesn't fit the other categories? This is the right place for you! You can ask or give anything, from construction to walking somebody's dog.

When you can't find something you're looking for you can always post yourself.  
Just click on the "+" sign in the middle of the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen :
